                <p>I’m a producer-manager with an obsession for good design—and an appreciation for all the hard work that goes into it. I love solving puzzles and problems, value collaboration and love working with a team to create awesome things. In my free time I screenwrite (something I'm trying to do more of) and make my own ice cream (something I'm trying to do less of). I also work on this website. I’m never not learning. </p>

            <div id= "aboutSite" class = "about-box">
                <p>The website started as personal project during the Covid-19 pandemic and the “New York on Pause” stay-at-home order. I spent my time in quarantine studying: Agile project management, UX/UI design, and front-end web development. The site is intended to showcase what I’ve learned and what I can do.</p>

                <p>What is "Noble-Pursuits?" I mean, come on. What Millennial doesn’t dream of starting their own lifestyle brand, right???  At least that was my intention in 2017 when I snagged the @noble_pursuits Instagram handle (Oh, 2017… those were simpler times). In 2020 Noble-Pursuits is a venue for me to celebrate the hard work and dedication it takes to create something that can inspire others; a platform to dissect what makes a design good or art impactful or music moving and to discuss how these objects and artifacts, the artists and artisans enrich society.</p>
